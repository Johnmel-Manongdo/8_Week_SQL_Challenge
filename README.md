# 8 Week SQL Challenge

This repository contains all my solutions for the [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/).

## Overview

The 8 Week SQL Challenge consists of 8 case studies, each focused on different aspects of SQL, including data manipulation, aggregation, and complex query formulation. Throughout this challenge, I have tackled various problems that simulate real-life business situations, which helped deepen my understanding of SQL.
